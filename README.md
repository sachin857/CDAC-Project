**** Dynamic AutoScaling of Ollama Server for Efficient Load Management ****

This project investigates the development and implementation of a dynamic auto-scaling solution for Ollama servers to optimize resource utilization and performance under varying workloads.
By leveraging monitoring techniques, the proposed system aims to automatically adjust the number of Ollama instances to align with real-time demand, ensuring optimal resource allocation and user experience.
